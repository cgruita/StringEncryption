# StringEncryption

1. Each word in the input string is replaced with the following: the first letter of the word, the count of
distinct letters between the first and last letter, and the last letter of the word. For
example, â€œAutomotive parts" would be replaced by "A6e p3s".

2. A "word" is defined as a sequence of alphabetic characters, delimited by any non-alphabetic
characters.

3. Any non-alphabetic character in the input string should appear in the output string in its original
relative location.
